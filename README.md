Generally, there are negative relationship between population density and car owning proportion. This project verifies the regularity in West Yorkshire, and investigates pattern of such relationship by k-means clustering and data visualization in the scale of MSOA. 

The population density and car ownership data are from 2021 UK census, downloaded from https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/, and processed for uploading and using. The data are counted by residents per square kilometre and by household respectively. Spatial data of the MSOAs is from https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/ . All the datasets are uploaded onto the GitHub repository and read from GitHub repository by codes in the project when using. Thus, codes in the Jupyter notebook of the project can be directly run.

Processes of coding in this project mainly includes packages importing, data preparing, modeling by K-means clustering and data visualization. The data preparing process includes data importing, cleaning, joining and other relevant processing. For visualisation, a non-spatial visualisation and a spatial visualisation of the results are performed.

The target audience of the project are researchers and policymakers of transport. This project can provide reference and insight to automobile and traffic management.
